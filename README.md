# Angular-E-Commerce-Store

  ## Description

  Using the [Infernal Redux Toolkit Shop](https://github.com/r134x7/infernal-redux-toolkit-shop) which was a MERN stack app using Redux Toolkit as the base of this project. I started a blank Angular v15 project (and then upgraded to Angular v16) and went to make a front-end only version of the above app that imitates the MERN stack version as closely as possible. The biggest difference between the two apps is that this runs on Angular v16 and uses RxJS observables and behaviorSubjects to handle the same job that the Redux Toolkit state management did except the RxJS applied here did not use state management. The only instance of the use of the new Angular Signals that occured was the RxJS interop package to provide "toSignal" which allowed the behaviorSubject's source value to be detected in the view.
